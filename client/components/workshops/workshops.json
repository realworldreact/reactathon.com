    "description": "JavaScript is evolving quickly. The mega ES6 specification was released in 2015 and is quickly being implemented by modern JS interpreters. New versions of ECMAScript will now be released on a yearly basis with new features going through a 4-stage proposal process. We can leverage features in ES6, ES2016, and those slated for future versions right now to write even clearer and more concise React code. Experience with JavaScript will help you get the most out of this hands-on workshop, but you don’t have to have a JavaScript black belt to leave feeling confident in 'ES.next.' Learn how to write cleaner code using arrow functions, destructuring, rest parameters, and other ES.next features you’re likely to use and benefit from on a daily basis while developing with React. Oh, and don’t worry if you didn’t understand any of those terms — you soon will after this workshop.",

    "description": "With all the buzzwords flying around the Javascript/React ecosystem, today one that still can't shake intimidation is \"Webpack\". Some of us have just grabbed an example configuration to get our app running or used its' middleware in conjunction with some \"legacy\" build tools. But most of us haven't really take time to understand why it's emerging as the dominant build tool for modular Javascript applications. In this workshop we are going shed that intimidation and unlock the power of Webpack. By the time you leave, you should feel comfortable building and understanding the basics of a Webpack configuration and iterating on it, unlocking more features as your application demands.",
